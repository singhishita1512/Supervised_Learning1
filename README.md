Estimation of Scour Downstream of a Ski- Jump Bucket using Supervised Machine Learning.
Description- In hydraulic engineering studies, study of dimensions of scour holes is very important since projects, like highhead dam projects, are often accompanied by cavitation and scouring as a result of energy dissipation. Since this scouring depends on the flow of water, structure as well as the integral properties of the riverbed, it requires proper usage of input variables.

Achievements- 
1) Compared multiple algorithms, while simultaneously studying the effect of increasing input variables.
2) Comparsion of linear regression algorithms, probabilistic regression models, boosting algorithms and other decision tree based models.
3) Studied effect of outliers and scaling.
4) Reduced execution time by over 50% by reducing the cross- validation value (GridSearchCV) when using RandomForest, XGboost and decision tree.
5) Looked into Boostrtapping based differences in Random Forest and Extra Trees Regressor.
